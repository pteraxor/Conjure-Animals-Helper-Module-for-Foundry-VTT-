# My Content Module

Some important things to consider with this module:

1-the things in the compendium were populated with plutonium, so keep that in mind
2-the chat message "/endallcja" can be used to get rid of all conjured tokens no matter the circumstances
3-the chat message "/rollcj" will add all conjured to combat, which would likely also double them up if they are already in combat
4-this will not work if you don't first important the actor compendium into the actor folder.
